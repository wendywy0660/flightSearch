I have decided to take up challenge #2 based on time and expertise in the area. My general motivation is to keep the design simple and focus on the data. I have used following tools/libraries for this assignment:

* Automation tool: Grunt and bower is used for building process, such as compile LESS, autoprefixer, minification, concatenation and jshint etc.

* Library: 
	* Bootstrap is used as a base css framework for grid system, form style and typography. 
	* Material Design for Bootstrap is used as a theme
	* noUiSlider is used because it is light weight and support different devices with touch support
	* bootstrap-datepicker is used here, which provides a flexible datepickerwidget in the Bootstrap style  

* Responsive : it has multiple layouts based on various screen size. Media query is used to determine sizes.
 
 * Browser Support: IE8+ and all the latest versions of the modern browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Opera. Polyfill library is used to support html5 tags and media query on IE8
 
* SEO and Accessibility considered in the html markup
